This data is from a Webb Research Slocum glider deployed in the gulf of Maine, 
generally on a transect that mirrors the path of the ferry that ran between 
Portland Maine and Yarmouth Nova Scotia.  Data are collected from a SeaBird CTD, 
a WetLABS bbfl2s (backscatter at 532nm, chl fluorescence and CDOM fluorescence), a 
Satlantic OCR507R (7 wavelengths of upwelling radiance) and a Satlantic OCR507I 
(7 wavelengths of downwelling irradiance).  Data is only sampled on the upward 
portion of each yo.
