This data is from a Webb Research Slocum glider deployed in the gulf of Maine, 
generally on a transect that mirrors the path of the ferry that ran between 
Portland Maine and Yarmouth Nova Scotia.  Data are collected from a SeaBird 
CTD, a WetLABS bbfl2s (backscatter at 532nm, chl fluorescence and CDOM 
fluorescence), an aanderaa optode, a Satlantic OCR507R (4 wavelengths of 
upwelling radiance) and a Satlantic OCR504I (4 wavelengths of downwelling 
irradiance).  Data is only sampled on the upward portion of each yo.
